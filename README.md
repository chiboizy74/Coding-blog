# Coding Blog + Snippet Library (Starter)

A minimal, fast static site you can deploy on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

## Features
- Plain HTML/CSS + a pinch of JS â€” no build step.
- Prism.js syntax highlighting via CDN.
- Copy-to-clipboard buttons on every code block.
- Posts + Snippets structure so you can ship fast.

## Quick Start
1. **Open** this folder in VS Code.
2. Edit `index.html` (title, links) and `assets/styles.css` (colors/spacing).
3. Add or edit posts inside `/posts/` and snippets inside `/snippets/`.
4. Commit to a GitHub repo and enable **GitHub Pages** (or drop the folder into Netlify).
5. Update the newsletter link in the navbar if you use Substack or Buttondown.

## Suggested Niche
Pick one lane (e.g., "Beginner JavaScript"). Keep posts short, practical, and searchable.

## Structure
```
/
  index.html
  snippets.html
  assets/styles.css
  posts/01-todo-30-lines.html
  posts/02-dom-cheatsheet.html
  snippets/*.html (optional if you later split them)
```
